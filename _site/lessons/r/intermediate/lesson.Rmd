We are localizing web literacy content to create an accessible place for school kids to be educated in their local language. The organization will produce short lectures in the form of YouTube videos in localized Indian language for teachers and parents to understand as an introduction, with a vision to encourage and teach other people to contribute and localize their web literacy content. The website will also include supplementary practice exercises and tools for educators. All resources will be open source and available to users of the website. The website and its content will be provided mainly in Indian dialects, but contributors are also encouraged to localize content in their local languages like French, Spanish, Botswana..">

# Strings, factors, and regular expressions

Install these packages:

install.packages(c("stringr", "forcats"))
```

Base R has some pretty decent string manipulation and searching functionality.
The primary way of working with strings is through 
[regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/). Regular
expressions, or regex in R, are a group of characters that have special meaning
and function. For instance, the `.` means wildcard and it will search for any
character (letter, number, symbol, etc). Or `$` means end of the string or line.
If you want to see more details on regex in R, run `?regex` to get help on it.

In general, the most commonly used functions (at least that I use and that I've
seen) are `grep`, `grepl`, `sub`, and `gsub` commands. Each of these take regex
characters (`$ ^ * . + ? [] () |` are a few; see `?regex` for more). Let's
begin with the base R functions!

```{r}
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")

# replace `a` at beginning of string with nothing. `gsub` = global substitution
gsub("^a", "", fruits)
# replace letters `an` or `ar` with `bb`
gsub("(an|ar)", "bb", fruits)
# same as above but only first search and replace. `sub` = substitution
sub("(an|ar)", "bb", fruits)
# search for fruits starting with a. Returns the number position of the search
# result.
grep("^a", fruits)
# same as above, but returns the actual value rather than the number
grep("^a", fruits, value = TRUE)
# same as above, but returns a vector of logical values
grepl("^a", fruits)
```

While base R is pretty powerful, it isn't always easy to work with and there are
some major bits of functionality missing. That's where the `stringr` package
(which is a subset of common functions from the `stringi` package) comes into
play. `stringr` greatly expands on string manipulation in R. Let's go through
some.

```{r}
library(stringr)

# month.name is a default variable in R. I'm putting it in a new variable to
# make it shorter to type out.
mth <- month.name
mth

# Almost every stringr function begins with `str_`.
# Convert cases (lower case, UPPER CASE)
str_to_lower(mth)
str_to_upper(mth)

# Find out the number of characters in each string of the vector
str_length(mth)
mth

# Combine (concatenate) the strings together. Similar to `paste`
str_c(mth, collapse = ", ")

# Take a subset of the months based on a regex.
# for months starting with `J`
str_subset(mth, "^J")
# for months ending in y
str_subset(mth, "y$")
# for months that contain either s, n, or d (only lower case)
str_subset(mth, "[snd]")
# same as above, but all letters since months have been converted to lower case
str_subset(str_to_lower(mth), "[snd]")

# Because stringr is part of the tidyverse packages, you can also use the pipe
# `%>%` command with the commands, to make it easier to read.
mth %>%
    str_to_lower() %>%
    str_subset("[snd]")

# Using the fruit variable in the stringr package... different from the `fruits`
# we created above!
# str_detect converts to logical, for use in filtering, subsetting, etc.
# searches for all fruit beginning with `be`
str_detect(fruit, "^be")

# Find out the proportion (mean of values that are either 0 or 1) of fruit with
# at least one vowel at the end of the string.
str_detect(fruit, "[aeiou]$") %>%
    mean()

# search for any fruit that does not end in an `a`
str_detect(fruit, "^.*[^a]$")
# this is the same as above, but subsets instead
str_subset(fruit, "[^a]$")

# similar to sub
# search any month that starts with J and ends with e and replace the middle
# letters with `HIII`.
str_replace(mth, "^(J).*(e)$", "\\1HIII\\2")

# vector of sentences
head(sentences)

# you can split strings up by a specific character. `str_split` creates a list,
# so I use `[[1]]` or `[1]` to show only the first one.
str_split(sentences, " ")[[1]] # this outputs a vector
str_split(sentences, " ")[1] # this outputs a list
# or split by the letter `e`
str_split(sentences, "e")[[1]]
# if you want to split by the word, use the `boundary` function.
str_split(sentences, boundary("word"))[[1]]
# or by a sentence
str_split(sentences, boundary("sentence"))[[1]]

# include in a pipe
str_split(sentences, boundary("sentence"))[[1]] %>%
    # convert to Title Case
    str_to_title()
```

String manipulation is great, but sometimes you need to convert to factor
variables for use in statistical models or when plotting (for instance when
using `ggplot2`). The `forcats` package makes it easier to work with factors.
Base R really only has one function for working with factors... the `factor`
command.

```{r}
library(forcats)

str(mth)
# This is base function. Compare this...
as.factor(mth)
# with this...
as_factor(mth)
# base R as.factor orders alphabetically, while forcats as_factor orders in
# appearance.

mth2 <- c(mth[10:12], mth[6:12], mth)
mth2

# you can also order by frequency:
fct_infreq(mth2)
# this more explicitly orders by appearance.
fct_inorder(mth2)

# this counts the number of levels within the factors. It is a simple summary
fct_count(mth2, sort = TRUE)

# if you want to convert levels that contains only a few (in this case, less the
# 10% of the total proportion), they will be converted to `Other`. This is a
# nice, quick function to group together uncommon values.
fct_lump(mth2, prop = 0.1)
# or any level with only an n=1 in the category
fct_lump(mth2, n = 1)
# or if you want them renamed to `None`
fct_lump(mth2, prop = 0.1, other_level = 'None')

# this is also a really nice function to rename levels within a factor.
fct_recode(mth2,
           Jan = "January",
           Feb = "February",
           "Dec ember" = "December"
           )

```
